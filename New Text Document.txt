6 LEDs Blinking Using Arduino in Proteus:

Overview:
In Proteus, you can simulate an 
Arduino controlling 6 LEDs to blink 
in sequence or together. 
This is a basic project for 
learning Arduino programming 
and Proteus circuit simulation.


Circuit Description:
Place an Arduino UNO board in Proteus.

Connect 6 LEDs to Arduino digital pins (e.g., Pin 13,12,11,10,9,8).

Connect 220Î© resistors in series with each LED to limit current.

The cathode (short leg) of each LED connects to GND, 
and the anode connects to Arduino pins through the resistors.
